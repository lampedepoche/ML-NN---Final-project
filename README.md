## Final project: Predicting Individual Synchrony in Drumming Experiments
Project produced on data kindly shared by the Social Neuroscience Laboratory, led by Ilanit Gordon (Brain Center, Israel). <br>
This project was produced as part of the Machine Learning and Neural Netword course, taught by Osnnat Bar-Shira (Bar-Ilan University, Israel). <br>
Group members are Arna Aimysheva and Sophie Lepennetier.

Two notebooks are available: one for imputing missing data and the other for data exploration and model training. <br>
Objective: regression to predict synchrony. <br>
Models trained: Ridge Regression, Support Vector Regression and ElasticNet Regression.
