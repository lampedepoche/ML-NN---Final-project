## Final-project: Predicting Individual Synchrony in Drumming Experiments
Project produced on data kindly shared by the Social Neuroscience Laboratory, led by Ilanit Gordon (Brain Center, Israel).
This project was produced as part of the Machine Learning and Neural Netword course, taught by Osnnat Bar-Shira (Bar-Ilan University, Israel).
Group members are Arna Aimysheva and Sophie Lepennetier.

Two notebooks are available: one for imputing missing data and the other for data exploration and model training.
Objective: regression to predict synchrony
Models trained: Ridge Regression, Support Vector Regression and ElasticNet Regression
